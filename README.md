📫 Welcome! My nick is @SkyeFell though everyone calls me ~Skye✨

I'm a dreamer specialized in bringing ideas into reality through code
I have a three year experience as a Software Developer, both backend, frontend and in general maintenance

🌺 I have knack for anything creative, reflected in my favourite projects, all related to web development, Monitoring and Control and Security Management

💜 It is in my beliefs that anything can be improved upon by a touch of art, even the most mundane and repetitive tasks

⏭ I've been working with and learning nodejs, python, java and all the variants that C has to offer, focusing more on the base languages rather than the possible frameworks, 
   as that is my next step. No language scares me, as it usually takes me no longer than a week to come to learn it

If there's a project you think I could help improve or bring to reality, feel free to contact me on Discord: Skye~#6024 

I'm always up for a chat ^-^
